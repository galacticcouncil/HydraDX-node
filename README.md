## Local Development

Follow these steps to prepare a local Substrate development environment :hammer_and_wrench:

### Simple Setup

Install all the required dependencies with a single command (be patient, this can take up to 30
minutes).

```bash
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
```

### Manual Setup

Find manual setup instructions at the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/#manual-installation).

### Build

Once the development environment is set up, build the node. This command will build the
[Wasm](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#wasm-execution) and
[native](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#native-execution) code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Run

### Single Node Development Chain

Purge any existing dev chain state:

```bash
./target/release/hack-hydra-dx purge-chain --dev
```

Start a dev chain:

```bash
./target/release/hack-hydra-dx --dev
```

Or, start a dev chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/hack-hydra-dx -lruntime=debug --dev
```

### Interaction with the node

Go to the polkadot apps at https://dotapps.io

Then open settings screen -> developer and paste

*NOTE - FixedU128 type is not yet implemented for polkadot apps. Balance is a measure so price can be reasonably selected. If using polkadot apps to create pool:*
- 1 Mega Units equals 1:1 price
- 20 Mega Units equals 20:1 price
- 50 Kilo Units equals 0.05:1 price

```
{
  "Amount": "i128",
  "AmountOf": "Amount",

  "BalanceInfo": {
