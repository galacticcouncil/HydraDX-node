We are welcoming and friendly community please follow our [Code of Conduct](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Local Development

Follow these steps to prepare a local Substrate development environment :hammer_and_wrench:

### Simple Setup

Install all the required dependencies with a single command (be patient, this can take up to 30
minutes).

```bash
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
```

### Manual Setup

Find manual setup instructions at the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/#manual-installation).

### Build

Once the development environment is set up, build the node. This command will build the
[Wasm](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#wasm-execution) and
[native](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#native-execution) code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Run

### Local Testnet

Relay chain repository (polkadot) has to be built in `../polkadot`
Install `polkadot-launch` utility used to start network.

```
npm install -g polkadot-launch
```

Start local testnet with 4 relay chain validators and HydraDX as a parachain with 2 collators.

```
cd ./rococo-local
polkadot-launch config.json
```

Observe HydraDX logs

```
multitail 99*.log
```

### Local Testnet with Zombienet

Relay chain repository (polkadot) has to be built in `../polkadot`
Grab `zombienet` utility used to start network from [releases](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases)

Start local testnet with 4 relay chain validators and HydraDX as a parachain with 2 collators.

```
cd ./rococo-local
zombienet spawn config-zombienet.json
```

### Interaction with the node

Go to the polkadot apps at https://dotapps.io

Then open settings screen -> developer and paste

*NOTE - FixedU128 type is not yet implemented for polkadot apps. Balance is a measure so price can be reasonably selected. If using polkadot apps to create pool:*
- 1 Mega Units equals 1:1 price
- 20 Mega Units equals 20:1 price
- 50 Kilo Units equals 0.05:1 price

### Performance check

Prerequisites: rust/cargo, python 3.8+

With the following script it is possible to run a simple performance check. It might be useful
to determine whether your machine is suitable to run HydraDX node.

From the top-level node directory:

```bash
./scripts/check_performance.sh
```

This will run a series of benchmarks ( which may take a while).
The output will show benchmark results of HydraDX pallets and comparison against reference values.

The most interesting information would be the difference between the HydraDx benchmark value and the local machine's benchmark.

If the difference is >= 0, performance is similar or better.
However, if the difference < 0 - your machine might not be suitable to run HydraDX node. Contact HydraDX devs to discuss the results.

### Testing of storage migrations and runtime upgrades

The `try-runtime` tool can be used to test storage migrations and runtime upgrades against state from a real chain.
Run the following command to test against the state on HydraDX
```bash
cargo run --release --features=try-runtime try-runtime --no-spec-name-check on-runtime-upgrade live --uri wss://rpc.hydradx.cloud:443
```
or against HydraDX testnet on Rococo
```bash
cargo run --release --features=try-runtime try-runtime --no-spec-name-check on-runtime-upgrade live --uri wss://rococo-hydradx-rpc.hydration.dev:443
```
